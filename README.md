# My Power Station Technology (Pty) Ltd, formerly Orbital Decisions, hence the OD component prefix

All Orbital Decisions components now in a single Package

Copyright is with My Power Station Technology, but anyone can use these components free of charge. We would like you to refer to us.


## Purpose

Have fun with Delphi and use components that make our lives easier.
eg: we wrote the calendar component to allow us to enter an end date before a start date. eg you open a calendar in May
and you want a report from 15th April until 14th May. Why must you back tab to April, select 15, then forward tab to May
and select 14. With our component, you right click on the end date, and left click on the start date. Plus we added
all kinds of other selections, eg week, month, year, etc.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, just `clone` this repository.

## Notes

At the moment, only ODCalendar, now VCL.ODCalendar is in the repo.
